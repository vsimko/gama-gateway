= Introduction =

This page should provide an overview of the implementation approach and the current status of database adapters. The information provided here is useful for content partners interested in a brief description about the way their data is *translated* to the GAMA format. Also the various *quality checks* are briefly described here.

*Added by Viliam Simko:* From my point of view, XML files are prepared directly by the content partner. Sometimes, there are references to URIs that do not represent real Works. This seems to be a problem of the exporting script of the content partner that the db-adapter cannot solve. Therefore the QA checks include following procedure:
 * Validity of URIs is performed for all works (eg. spaces are not allowed)
 * Every work must contain at least title, description and creation date

All identified problems are written to a single file which is sent to the content partner.

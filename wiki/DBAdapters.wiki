#summary Description of DB-Adapters for individual content providers
#labels Phase-QA,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

This page should provide an overview of the implementation approach and the current status of database adapters. The information provided here is useful for content partners interested in a brief description about the way their data is *translated* to the GAMA format. Also the various *quality checks* are briefly described here.


== DB-Adapter: Ars Electronica Center ==

XML files are prepared directly by the content partner.<br/>
They underlie a simplified schema and therefore have to be transformed to GAMA schema.<br/>
*Persons*
 * Unfortunately the type of person (real person/collective) is not given, so this have to be mapped. The content partner created an Excel sheet for this reason.
 * Life_span is also not provided.
 * 67 without person_country.
*Works*
 * There are duplicates, e.g. 5x Event:11993 (everyone has an other image_url)
 * The received files also do not contain worktypes/genres and keywords.
 * 73 works have no creator
 * 671 have no description.

== DB-Adapter: Argos vzw Centre for Art and Media ==

Content partner provide a database dump with all required informations, including mapping.<br/>
Only keywords are not provided atm.<br/>
*=> There are problems with encoding of the new database dump <=*

== DB-Adapter: C³ Center for Culture & Communication ==

XML files are prepared directly by the content partner.<br/>
They underlie a simplified schema and therefore have to be transformed to GAMA schema.<br/>
*Persons*
 * 91 without life_span.
 * 81 without Person_country.
*Works*
 * 10 works have no creator
 * 76 works have worktypes that do no match to the kind of work
 ** 72 events   with work_type  Documentation (worktype of a resource)
 ** 3 artworks with work_type  Documentation (worktype of a resource)
 ** 1 artwork  with work_type  Conference    (worktype of an event)

== DB-Adapter: Filmform ==

Connection via ODBC (Filemaker database -> only *Windows driver* given).<br/>
*Persons*
 * 37 without life_span
 * 10 without person_country
*Works*
All works have a worktype and a creation date, 2 have no creator and 15 no description.

== DB-Adapter: Heure Exquise ! ==

Content partner want(ed) to create a new database. <br/>
We are still waiting for it.<br/>

In the old database in case of persons only names were given and sometimes 'kind of person' were incorrect.

== DB-Adapter: Les Instants Vidéo ==



== DB-Adapter: Netherlands Media Art Institute - Montevideo/Time Based Arts ==

Database dump given.

*Persons*
 * 311 without life_span.
 * 283 without person_country
*Works*
 * artworks
 ** 1719 without work_type
 ** 366 without has_creator
 ** 72 without work_created
 ** 864 without work_description
 ** Countries given in text format => transformation to ISO-Codes
 * events 
 ** 2 without WorkTypes. 
 ** 1 without description. 
 * resources (Documentations of events)
 ** 37 without description.
 ** 3 without work_created
 ** 178 without related events
 ** no related persons included yet because roles of artists are unclear

== DB-Adapter: DIVA ==

*Added by Viliam Simko:* From my point of view, XML files are prepared directly by the content partner. Sometimes, there are references to URIs that do not represent real Works. This seems to be a problem of the exporting script of the content partner that the db-adapter cannot solve. Therefore the QA checks include following procedure:
 * Validity of URIs is performed for all works (eg. spaces are not allowed)
 * Every work must contain at least title, description and creation date

All identified problems are written to a single file which is sent to the content partner.

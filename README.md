# Gama Gateway RDF Repository 

However, the RDF-Repository developed through the Gama Gateway project is a self-contained application that might be interesting also from outside of the Gama Gateway community.
It consists of the following components:
 * **GamaLib**: Code shared also by other components in the Gama Gateway project.
 * **GamaRepository**: Code specific to the RDF-repository.
 * **GamaSchema**: Metamodel used in the Gama Gateway project.
 * **GamaSync**: A set of scripts (simple REST api) that implements update of the repository content.
 * **GamaLevenshtein**: MySQL UDF extensions for computing Levenshtein distance.

# Gama Gateway RDF Repository 

However, the RDF-Repository developed through the Gama Gateway project is a self-contained application that might be interesting also from outside of the Gama Gateway community.
It consists of the following components:
 * [**GamaLib**](GamaLib/): Code shared also by other components in the Gama Gateway project.
 * [**GamaRepository**](GamaRepository/): Code specific to the RDF-repository.
 * [**GamaSchema**](GamaSchema/): Metamodel used in the Gama Gateway project.
 * [**GamaSync**](GamaSync/): A set of scripts (simple REST api) that implements update of the repository content.
 * [**GamaLevenshtein**](GamaLevenshtein/): MySQL UDF extensions for computing Levenshtein distance.
